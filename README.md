# Dice-Rolling-Simulator
The Dice Rolling Simulator is a simple C program that simulates the rolling of a dice. It uses the rand() function to generate random numbers between 1 and 6, giving users a real dice-like experience. 
Dice-Rolling-Simulator
This project helps in understanding important programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and functions. The random numbers are generated using the rand() function from the <stdlib.h> library, which is seeded with the current system time using srand(time(0)) to ensure that each roll gives a different result.

⚙️ Features

Simulates rolling a six-sided dice.

Generates truly random results using the rand() function.

Allows users to roll multiple times until they choose to exit.

Simple and interactive command-line interface.

🧠 Concepts Used

Loops (while/do-while) – to repeat dice rolls.

Conditional statements – to control program flow.

Random number generation – using stdlib.h and time.h.

Basic I/O operations – using printf() and scanf().
